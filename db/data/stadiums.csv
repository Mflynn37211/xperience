It just doesn't make sense to be anywhere else! M&T Bank Stadium is located at the south point of Camden Yards and is the crowning jewel of the NFL's premier sports facilities. Baltimore Ravens fans - proud of their Baltimore heritage - enjoy the latest in technology, including state-of-the-art high definition RavensVision video screens. Combined with extraordinary amenities, including a stunning view of the city's skyline, the game's excitement brings fans to their feet. With a capacity of 71,008, this aesthetic structure is the home of the Ravens and draws its design from Baltimore's architecture. Completed in 1998 at an estimated cost of $220 million, the stadium has 119 suites and 8,196 club seats. HOK architects designed Oriole Park at Camden Yards and M&T Bank Stadium. The latter was completed in less than 2 years and funded through a combination of proceeds generated from the sale of tax-exempt revenue bonds, debt service paid by lottery proceeds and the Ravens. In November of 2013, the Baltimore Ravens, in partnership with the Maryland Stadium Authority, earned a LEED-certified “Gold” designation for M&T Bank Stadium from the U.S. Green Building Council.  M&T Bank Stadium is the first existing outdoor professional sports facility in the United States – including all NFL and Major League Baseball stadiums – to receive USGBC’s Gold rating. A LEED certification is recognized across the globe as the premier mark of achievement in green building.”",1967
